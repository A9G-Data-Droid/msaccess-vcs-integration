Synchronize your Microsoft Access Database definition with a version control system.

Note that this version has taken a significantly different direction from the original (and primary) project maintained at <https://github.com/timabell/msaccess-vcs-integration>.

This project works as a Microsoft Access add-in, loaded on demand from the VBE IDE, and is designed to work with ADP projects as well as the main accdb format. This project is under development for internal use, but I will try to push updates to GitHub as I am able.
